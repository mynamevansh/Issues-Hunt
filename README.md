# Issues Hunt #

Issues such as “good first issue” or “help wanted” are difficult to find. Right now a user would have to click on a specific repository and look through their issues to apply label filters. Being able to find issues easier would encourage more people, especially novice programmers, to contribute to open source projects.

### User Story:
* User can search for GitHub Issues across all repositories
* User can filter results by language and label
* User can then sort the results
